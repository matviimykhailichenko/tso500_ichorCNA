Everyone still has to learn many ways to Git Gud.

A comprehensive "How to contribute" section and a general "code of conduct" section might be added later.
This file contains:
 - "Project status":
 - "How to contribute": if you find an error, have a clever idea how to improve this tool intended for cfDNA sequencing data analysis from TSO500 ctDNA panel, please read this section carefully!
                        Any constructive contribution is well received and a place among the list of contributors is yours!
 - "List of Contributors": the magnificent individuals who strive to make the world a better place, including through their contribution to this humble NGS data pre-processing tool!

# Project status: in production


# How to contribute:
!! THIS SECTION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION !!

Before pushing anything to the repo, please:
  0) create an issue in the repo, describing the problem you are trying to solve and your approach to get it done
  1) checkout the "dev" branch and test if your problem still exists
  2) create and checkout a feature branch (from dev) using a descriptive name of the feature/problem
  3) implement AND test your changes
  4) merge your feature branch into the dev branch of the original repository using a pull request ("Contribute" button in github.com) where you describe your changes

Rules applying to all branches (in the future):
 - signed commits only

Rules applying only to main branch:
 - contribution requires a merge request from another branch
 - merging pull requests requires an approval first
